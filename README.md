Convolutional Neural Net Classifier Based On the Paper "Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification" by Yoon Kim.

Written with Python and Keras, this code tests binary classification on two datasets. The first is a subjectivity data filled with positive and negative movie reviews. The second is a dataset for gender classification based on written text. Please note, this code does not run "out of the box". Due to the size of the datasets and individual machine limitations, in order for the code to run you will need to download the desired datasets and word embeddings. With them, you will need to reshape the matrices and tensors to your specific needs. Resources for the word embeddings and datasets are below.
